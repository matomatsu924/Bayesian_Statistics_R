## 2.1. A bit of History

``` r
set.seed(20202020)
boxes <- sample(c("GG", "SS","GS"),
                size=10^5, replace = TRUE,
                prob=c(1/3,1/3,1/3))
table(boxes)/10^5
```

    boxes
         GG      GS      SS 
    0.33333 0.33413 0.33254 

Each box appears with about 1/3 probability as expected. Now, let’s
simulate what dagger they will see first.

``` r
dagger <- rbinom(10^5, size = 1, prob=c(1,.5,0)[as.numeric(as.factor(boxes))])
```

The elements of the vector ‘dagger’ take the value of ‘0’ for silver and
‘1’ for gold. The probability of golden dagger depends on the box. If
you are unsure about any piece of the code, go deeper. Check:

``` r
boxes[1:5]#Factores de ejemplo (contenido de cajas)
```

    [1] "GG" "SS" "SS" "GS" "GG"

``` r
as.factor(boxes)[1:5] #Levels de esas cajas
```

    [1] GG SS SS GS GG
    Levels: GG GS SS

``` r
as.numeric(as.factor(boxes)[1:5]) #Convertilas en valores numéricos ("discretos")
```

    [1] 1 3 3 2 1

``` r
c(1,.5,0)[as.numeric(as.factor(boxes))[1:5]] #Los convierte en numéricos "continuos" (probabilidad)
```

    [1] 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.5 1.0

and see what changes.

What is the frequency distribution of ones (gold dagger seen first) and
zeroes (silver dagger seen first)?

``` r
table(dagger)/10^5
```

    dagger
         0      1 
    0.5001 0.4999 

Pretty much 50/50. As expected.

#### King’s Gifts: Inverse Probability

Once the king has presented the box to the guest, and the guest viewed
one of the two daggers kept in it, they were invited to guess whether
the remaining unseen dagger was silver or gold.

What would you have guessed if you have opened the box and seen the gold
dagger?

We could use R to figure it out. Remember, we have simulated the boxes
and the viewed daggers:

``` r
set.seed(20202020)
boxes <- sample(c('GG','SS','GS'),
                size=10^5,replace=T,prob=c(1/3,1/3,1/3))
dagger <- rbinom(10^5,size=1,prob=c(1,.5,0)[as.numeric(as.factor(boxes))])

dtf <- data.frame(boxes=boxes, dagger=dagger)
print(head(dtf))
```

      boxes dagger
    1    GG      1
    2    SS      0
    3    SS      0
    4    GS      1
    5    GG      1
    6    GS      1

We can derive the unseen dagger from the above. (There are always
several ways to do any one thing in R, so you might come up with a
different solution, but here is one. Write a little function)

``` r
the.other.dagger <- function(box,dagger){
        1*(box=='GG')+0*(box=='SS')+(1-dagger)*(box=='GS')
}
```

The function states, that the other dagger in the GG box will be golden
(1). The other dagger in the SS box will be silver (0), and the other
dagger in the GS box will be 1 the if we have seen 0 and 0 if we have
seen 1 respectively.

Let’s apply it (and have a look to check that it appears to be working):

``` r
dtf$other <- the.other.dagger(dtf$boxes,dtf$dagger)
print(head(dtf))
```

      boxes dagger other
    1    GG      1     1
    2    SS      0     0
    3    SS      0     0
    4    GS      1     0
    5    GG      1     1
    6    GS      1     0

Now, let’s see what is the distribution of other dagger values, given
that the first dagger was made of gold (1):

``` r
table(dtf$other[dtf$dagger==1])
```


        0     1 
    16657 33333 

Turning into probabilities:

``` r
table(dtf$other[dtf$dagger==1])/sum(table(dtf$other[dtf$dagger==1]))
```


            0         1 
    0.3332066 0.6667934 

So, about 2/3 probability of the other dagger being golden and only
probability of the other dagger being silver. Which means, that if the
first dagger the guest sees is golden, the reasonable bet is that the
other one is too.

The simulations give you some intuition how things work. But, of course,
it would be nice to have a more rigorous method to hand. Enter the
Bayes’ Theorem.
